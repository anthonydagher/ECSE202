Assignments from Introduction to Software Development at McGill University
  These are the few projects from Prof. Frank Ferrie's course of software development. 

Assignment 2 is missing because it is essentially a simpler version of A3, if I remember correctly.


*DISCLAIMER*

  These are not perfect projects and shouldn't be copied.
    McGill University's Engineering department uses code-plagiarism software to detect any copied code.
